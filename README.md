# WordSearchGenerator
This word search generator will take user input to create a word search puzzle. The user is asked to enter the size of the grid, using numbers 5-20, and a list of words to build the puzzle. The length of the word cannot exceed the size of the grid that was entered. Once the puzzle is built, the user can rebuild the puzzle or create a new one. The words used to generate the puzzle are listed to the right of the puzzle, and any words that did not fit in the current puzzle are listed below the grid.
